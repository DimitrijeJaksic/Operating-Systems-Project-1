# Operating-Systems-Project-1
This is the first project for our Operating Systems course at Florida State University. The following are the project objectives:


 1. Design and develop a shell interface that supports input/output redirection, piping, background processing, and a set of built-in functions.
 2. Gain in-depth knowledge of process control mechanics, including parent-child relationships, process creation, and user-input parsing and verification.
 3. Enhance understanding of command-line parsing techniques and strategies.
 4.  Design and implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle various types of errors that may occur during shell execution.
